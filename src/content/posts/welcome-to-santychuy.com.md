I have spent years consuming a lot of content on the internet in various formats related to programming, technology, and related topics to stand out and perform better in my work routine (methods to improve your productivity, tools, etc.)

Less than a year ago, I became concerned about not just consuming but also starting to create content. I've given a lot of thought to whether it would be worth dedicating my time now to this new field, which will be new to me, and here we are taking the first steps.

## Why Santychuy.com?

> TL;DR: Having my own platform on which I can distribute my content to other large platforms

From the beginning, I wanted to solve the problem of not yet having my own platform (in this case, a website) to share and manage my content in the way I wanted.

Some might think, why not start on others first (Dev.to, LinkedIn, etc.) and then start your own blog?

I believe it's a path anyone would take to start, and it's advisable to get into the habit of writing continuously about any topic and forming a community, but I first wanted to tackle another problem I had been carrying, which was the **ability to plan and build a technological product from scratch** since I felt rusty for several reasons that I will share in a future post.

Having my own platform, the next step is to start sharing content in the following way:

1. [Santychuy.com](https://github.com/santychuycom/santychuy.com) will be **the main platform** that displays the content, and the project's repository will host the blog posts to distribute them to other platforms in their respective formats.

2. Through automations (WIP), distribute the content of each published blog automatically that will be listened to via RSS Feed to the platforms I want to target. This will be adjusted for each of them since not all platforms allow you to publish automatically today, and some manual adjustments have to be made, but the idea is to do as little work as possible.

## What's next?

The next steps will be to improve the platform, the content publication flow, and to be able to share consistently what I learn day by day, as I am 100% convinced that by sharing knowledge or thoughts from this field, I can improve as a professional.

In the long term, I will work on adapting a Discord server (in case you want to [join](https://discord.gg/B55We2GHF7)) to have a means of communication to share ideas instantly.

I have so many ideas that can be implemented, but I have to take the time to prioritize each one to have a sort of roadmap for Santychuy.com
